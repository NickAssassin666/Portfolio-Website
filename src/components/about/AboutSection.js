                  A Mechanical Engineer, Graduated from an NBA accradated
                  college who is entusiastic about learning, and gaining
                  knowledge. I so strongly believe Knowledge is what matters
                  most in this world which has a beginning but no end to it. No
                  matter how much you learn, there will always be more that you
                  wouldn't know about.

                  People always talk about what their superpower would be if
                  they ever were to get one and you already know what I want
                  mine to be ( the ability to learn things in an instant). I am
                  really interested in acquiring new skills and currently I am
                  doing a course on stock trading and HVAC and trying to better
                  my skills in Python.
